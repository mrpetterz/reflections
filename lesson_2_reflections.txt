What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git will start to track the version this directory. We need to do it to setup file versioning system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area presents which file to be commited next. Repository is a collection of many commits. Value it offers is a way for us developer to manage which file we want to commit into our repository because we don't want to commit all files together and cause unecessarry log.
