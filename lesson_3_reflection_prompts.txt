When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we work together with others to build something big.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because other people might work with us concurrently which will cause conflict and having our data messed up if our local gets updated automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Fork is a clone you makein gitHub where we do not have authority to modify the original = use in gitHub when we don't have authority to change the code of a repo
- Clones is a clone of a repository in your local drive whether it is pulled from gitHub or made locally from local repository = use when we need to pull from origin or clone local repo
- Branches is another path from our master origin where different function or fix is being implemented = use when we need to make an experiment, add function, or even bug shooting with no interuption to the master branch
