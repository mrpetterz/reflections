When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we work together with others to build something big.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because other people might work with us concurrently which will cause conflict and having our data messed up if our local gets updated automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Fork is a clone you makein gitHub where we do not have authority to modify the original = use in gitHub when we don't have authority to change the code of a repo
- Clones is a clone of a repository in your local drive whether it is pulled from gitHub or made locally from local repository = use when we need to pull from origin or clone local repo
- Branches is another path from our master origin where different function or fix is being implemented = use when we need to make an experiment, add function, or even bug shooting with no interuption to the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To check when we need push our commit to the remote whether someone else push another commit to the current remote. If someone push, we need to merge it and push a newly merged master.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would be using email to collaborate if there is no git or github. It would be easier if our program is small but it will be much harder when we work with many people on a large scale software.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
We need to make branch other than directly change the master when we need other to collaborate with us and get others to approve or comment on our changes. The benefit is that we did not directly alter the master in gitHub, that way we will not interfere with the core function of the program.
