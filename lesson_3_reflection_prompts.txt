When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we work together with others to build something big.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because other people might work with us concurrently which will cause conflict and having our data messed up if our local gets updated automatically.
